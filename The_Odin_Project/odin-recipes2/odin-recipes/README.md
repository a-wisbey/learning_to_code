# odin-recipes

This project is the first from The Odin Project Foundations course, where I have made a very simple HTML site.

Skills demonstrated:

- HTML
    - linking pages
    - adding images
    - use of pagagraphs and spacing
    - ordered and unordered lists
    - various heading sizes
    - protection against 'tabnabbing' by using rel="noopener noreferrer"
